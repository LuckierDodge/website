## 🏢 Internships and Work Experience

A winding path to figuring out what I want to be when I grow up, chronicled.

* Worked for a summer at a Walmart unloading trucks.
* Spent the next summer as a Software Development Intern at [Teradyne, Inc](http://www.teradyne.com/).
* Started working as a Computer Lab Attendant for NIU's [Residential Technologies Department](http://www.niu.edu/housing/student-services/restech/index.shtml), aka ResTech.
* Spent the following Summer as a IT/Systems Intern at [State Farm](https://www.statefarm.com/).
* Returned to ResTech in the fall, now as a HelpDesk technician.
* Went back to State Farm for another summer internship, this time in the freshly remixed Enterprise Technology division.
* Came back to the HelpDesk in the fall.
* Transitioned that semester to work as a Research Assistant in the ddiLab.
* Spent the summer after graduating with my B.S. as a Senior Research Aide at Argonne National Laboratory's Leadership Computing Facility (ANL's ALCF)
* Became a Graduate Research Assistant in the ddiLab, with a Visiting Student appointment continuing my work at the ALCF.
* Returned to the ALCF the following summer, and then spent a final year as a Graduate RA in the ddiLab.

## 🔬 Research Career

If you're looking for the publications and presentations I've gotten out of these efforts, [look no further](/pubs).

* 2 semesters as a Freshman working on my first research experience in NIU's amazing [Research Rookies](http://www.niu.edu/engagedlearning/undergraduate-research/research-rookies/index.shtml) program. Explored Photogrammetry under [Dr. Michael Papka](http://papka.alcf.anl.gov/) in the [Data, Devices, and Interactions Laboratory (ddiLab)](http://ddilab.cs.niu.edu).
* Another 2 semesters as a Sophomore in the same lab, now as a Research Rookies Peer Mentor. This time I explored 3D Printing solutions of complex brain structures.
* (If you're curious, you can check out the blog for those 4 semesters, forever preserved in it's young, innocent state on this [WordPress site](https://ryanlewisresearchrookies.wordpress.com/)).
* A semester in the ddiLab with a PROMISE scholar's grant, exploring interactions between 3D printing, muscle sensing, and VR.
* 2 semesters as an undergraduate research aide in the ddiLab, working with the [Array of Things](https://arrayofthings.github.io/) Dataset, PostgreSQL, Virtual Reality, and 3D printing. (Even got two pieces in an art exhibit, somehow!)
* 2 years at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility doing performance log analysis and visualization for their Leadership Supercomputers (mostly Mira and Theta), while also working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the ddiLab.
* 2 years in Argonne's CELS directorate working on Self-Directing Laboratories and Autonomous Discovery, first as an independent study project and then as a visiting student and research aide.
