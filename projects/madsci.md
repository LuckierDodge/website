## About MADSci

MADSci is the spiritual successor to [WEI]({{page.url}}../wei), and is intended to provide a modular toolkit with which to assemble self driving labs from any combination of automated instruments, resources, and functionalities the user might need.

It's still very much a work in progress (we're aiming for an Alpha release in the next couple weeks{% include footnote, num: 1, text: "As of 2025-01-19" %}), but I'm excited to take all the lessons we've learned from working on WEI and apply it to MADSci.
