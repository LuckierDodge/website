This site is an ad-, tracker-, analytic- and cookie-free zone, powered by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). I've tried to keep it as accessible as possible, and to keep JavaScript usage to a minimum. It uses the <a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization Standard</a>, and is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/LuckierDodge/website).

Everything I put up here is for personal and/or informative purposes only, and links to any code repositories or other works are governed by their respective licenses and owners/maintainers/copyright holders etc. Anyway, support open source projects, and be nice to each other out there!

_If you find a bug, experience any issues, see an accessibility problem, or anything else, feel free to let me know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/LuckierDodge/website/issues) or sending me an email at [public+website@ryandlewis.dev](mailto:public+website@ryandlewis.dev)._
