This site is an ad-, tracker-, analytic- and cookie-free zone, powered by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).
I also do my best to keep JavaScript to a minimum, for accessibility and to accommodate those folks who don't want to enable it.
It is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/LuckierDodge/website.git).

Everything I put up here is for personal and/or informative purposes only, and links to any code repositories or other works are governed by their respective licenses and owners/maintainers/copyright holders etc.

If you want to know about ways to support this site and its author, check out [this page](/support).

Anyway, support open source projects, and be nice to each other out there!
